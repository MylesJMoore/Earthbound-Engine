/// @description Choose move
//You can do whatever you want here, like giving the enemy a specific
//set of actions should some conditions apply, like it having less than an
//specific amount of HP or whatever.
//Usually you'll just choose from a list of User Events, though. Like so:
//event_user(choose(1,2,3))
//You can also summon the attacks from THIS event, if you want.
event_user(choose(1))
